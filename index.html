        <pre>Apple just released an iPhone that had
0:02
its charging port dictated by a
0:06
government and that government is not
0:09
stopping there this is one of the
0:11
biggest things happening in Tech right
0:13
now it could change the entire landscape
0:16
and while everyone is talking about the
0:18
new shiny thing or if that new shiny
0:20
thing is getting too hot this well this
0:25
is happening right under our
0:28
noses
0:33
well Apple was about 90 days away from
0:35
going bankrupt back then in the early
0:37
days and
0:39
um uh it was much worse than I thought
0:42
when I went back initially but there
0:45
were people there who I'd expected all
0:48
the good people would have left and I
0:50
found these miraculous people these
0:53
great people and I said why I I tried to
0:56
ask this as tactfully as I could but why
0:57
are you still here and
1:00
and you know a lot of them had this
1:02
little phrase they said I cuz I bleed in
1:05
six colors yeah which was the old six
1:08
color Apple logo and um that was code
1:12
for because I love this what this place
1:15
stand stands for or at least stood for
1:18
and um and that just made all of us want
1:22
to work that much harder
1:24
to have it survive and have those values
1:27
survive and bring it
1:28
back
1:32
the iPhone 15 lineup was just released
1:34
and yep if you didn't know for some
1:37
reason for the first time ever we have
1:40
USBC ports on iPhone instead of
1:44
lightning the kicker is that this was
1:47
not Apple's decision as far back as 2021
1:51
lawmakers within the European commission
1:54
have been trying to establish a common
1:56
charger rule for smartphones tablets and
1:59
other accessories and while at first
2:01
that might sound harmless if we say the
2:04
quiet part out loud here that law really
2:08
seems like it's more or less targeting
2:10
the big fruit company and if Apple
2:12
didn't want to be hit with equally
2:14
massive fines they were going to have to
2:16
play ball before the deadline of 2024
2:19
and that is where we are right now apple
2:21
is doing their part to play nice and is
2:24
currently in the process of completely
2:26
ditching lightning in favor of USBC on
2:29
pretty much everything we saw iPhone and
2:32
airpods make the switch with more and
2:34
more Apple stuff to jump ship as the
2:36
months pass because if you didn't know
2:38
corporations typically like to keep
2:40
their money and not pay it out in fines
2:43
to governments when they can help it
2:45
sure this change over to USBC for iPhone
2:48
is generally a big win for consumers as
2:50
a whole and Apple has definitely and
2:52
conveniently spun this little curveball
2:55
into a nice comfy upgrade like being
2:57
able to use iPhone to reverse charge
2:59
excess accessories and even record high
3:01
fidelity prores video directly into
3:04
external storage that of course is super
3:06
neat but now the other shoe is about to
3:10
drop have you ever read that little
3:12
kid's book If You Give a Mouse a Cookie
3:15
the gist of the book is that a little
3:17
boy gives a mouse a cookie but then the
3:19
mouse wants more than the cookie then
3:21
the mouse asks for a glass of milk and
3:24
then asks for a straw to go with the
3:26
milk and yeah you get it the European
3:28
commission just got the biggest cookie
3:31
that has ever been
3:36
baked you know vpns are great but what
3:39

3:41

4:40
online think about this for a second a
4:43
world government just made Apple the
4:45
most stubborn and stuck in their own
4:47
wild garden company that has ever
4:49
existed completely roll over and do a
4:52
little trick for them like bro they
4:54
actually won Tim Cook was slain in
4:57
Mortal Combat I remember when the news
5:00
hit that the EU had successfully passed
5:03
their law pretty much everyone was like
5:05
no way lol Apple can just pay the fines
5:08
there was no way right that Apple would
5:11
ditch lightning for a port that Android
5:13
devices use but uh here we are it
5:17
happened and now we're in a world where
5:20
USBC is the iPhone charging port no more
5:23
proprietary cords and we are well on our
5:26
way to no more lightning accessories no
5:28
more lightning
5:30
anything well wouldn't you know it that
5:32
cute little European Mouse and his cute
5:34
little European Mouse business suit is
5:36
now asking for some milk with that
5:39
cookie a week or so ago a chief of EU
5:42
industry Terry Braton publicly called on
5:45
Tim Cook to open up the iPhone's Walled
5:47
Garden ecosystem of hardware and
5:50
software
5:51
to rivals in a quote Terry said the next
5:56
job for apple and other big Tech under
5:59
the the dma digital markets Act is to
6:02
open up its gates to competitors be it's
6:05
the electronic wallet browsers or app
6:07
stores consumers using an Apple iPhone
6:10
should be able to benefit from
6:12
competitive Services by a range of
6:15
providers this doesn't seem like an
6:18
unreasonable request for most companies
6:21
and it can be hard to pinpoint where the
6:23
problem lies exactly for iPhone users
6:26
for Apple Fans in general but let's
6:29
really look at what this
6:32
means under this new dma law the digital
6:36
markets act Apple's major platforms like
6:39
the App Store Safari and IOS as a whole
6:43
were officially classified as
6:46
Gatekeepers and as a solution apple is
6:49
expected to add support for the side
6:51
loading of apps from outside the App
6:53
Store on iPhones and iPads Apple's
6:56
argument for their W Garden approach has
6:59
always been user security and privacy
7:02
obviously the lack of competition in
7:04
their own platform is another huge
7:07
positive and our guy ter was quick to
7:09
respond to that argument too in a quote
7:12
he said EU regulation Fosters innovation
7:15
without compromising on security and
7:17
privacy and in a very Apple move they
7:21
haven't responded to this comment but I
7:25
will this ised
7:28
up
7:30
we're just people running this company
7:32
we're trying to make great products for
7:34
people and so we we have at least the
7:36
courage of our convictions to say we
7:39
don't think this is part of what makes a
7:41
great product we're going to leave it
7:42
out some people are going to not like
7:44
that they're going to call us names it's
7:46
not going to be in certain companies
7:48
vested interests that we do that but
7:49
we're going to take the heat cuz we want
7:51
to make the best product in the world
7:53
for customers and we're going to instead
7:55
focus our energy on these Technologies
7:57
which we think are in their ascendency
7:58
and we think are going to be the right
8:00
Technologies for customers and you know
8:02
what they're paying us to make those
8:04
choices that's what a lot of customers
8:07
pay us to do is to try to make the best
8:10
products we can and if we succeed
8:12
they'll buy them and if we don't they
8:17
won't this opening of Apple's ecosystem
8:21
is not pro consumer this is not
8:24
something that the consumer Apple's
8:26
iPhone users specifically are even
8:28
asking for this is just
8:31
anti-apple and it's kind of gross
8:34
stripping a company of core values that
8:36
it grew on is like ripping the roots
8:40
from a tree this Walled Garden from
8:43
Apple the carefully crafted ecosystem of
8:46
hardware and software is the company
8:49
this is the experience this is why
8:53
people buy iPhones consumers do not want
8:56
an Android phone with an Apple logo on
8:58
the back they want an iPhone dude yeah
9:00
you know I'm a little annoyed here
9:02
honestly because I have been trying to
9:04
say this ever since we found out that
9:06
Apple was in fact going to comply that
9:09
we were getting USBC on an iPhone ever
9:11
since we found out that the EU is
9:13
getting their way I have been trying to
9:16
say that this is now a very very
9:19
slippery slope a government agency of
9:22
any kind being able to change and mold a
9:26
company away from its own DNA is nothing
9:30
but a misappropriation of power they got
9:33
the cookie and now they're coming for
9:36
more but where does this road
9:40
end I'm sorry if this is about choice if
9:44
this is about giving consumers more
9:46
choice I just very much disagree
9:49
consumers have choice right now if they
9:52
feel more comfortable with Apple's
9:54
business models they can have it if they
9:56
feel more comfortable with the freedom
9:58
of Android destroy they can have it they
10:00
can have both and they can have all of
10:02
the tiny nuances in between what the EU
10:05
is trying to force and any changes they
10:08
attempt to make following this if it
10:09
works out that doesn't Foster change in
10:14
fact I'd argue that longer term all it
10:17
does is make everything more the same if
10:21
the EU was trying to force Android to be
10:23
locked down like iOS would you be okay
10:27
with that I just want to know where's
10:29
the line where would you draw it
10:31
slippery slope arguments are all fun in
10:34
games and usually aren't a good way to
10:37
make a point that is until you start
10:39
watching One unfold Apple isn't Apple
10:43
because they're a gatekeeper and they
10:45
aren't anti-consumer because they don't
10:47
let you load up the Play Store on an
10:49
iPhone Apple is only able to create
10:51
these devices and these software
10:53
experiences because they're the only
10:56
game in town to this day Apple still has
10:59
one of the only ecosystems to truly
11:02
secure user data and make it a core
11:04
pillar of the entire company if we look
11:07
at what this EU law wants to accomplish
11:09
from Apple's side of
11:12
things what is there to gain like
11:15
actually why would Apple want to open up
11:18
the iPhone ecosystem to sideloading
11:21
other app stores or give users access to
11:24
things like Samsung pay or whatever when
11:27
they sell an iPhone to a customer they
11:29
know exactly what type of experience
11:31
that customer is going to have with an
11:33
iPhone that's because they control the
11:36
whole experience top to bottom Hardware
11:38
to software they control it all if they
11:41
give up that
11:42
control how is that better for Apple how
11:46
is that better for you in our the iPhone
11:49
15 has a serious problem video I said
11:52
that when Apple presents new ideas and
11:54
features and products they act like they
11:56
are the only company in the world the
11:59
the only one that matters to you it's
12:01
because of this Walled Garden this
12:03
ecosystem that apple is able to provide
12:05
the experience that billions of people
12:08
get to enjoy it's also what makes the
12:10
Iphone the bestselling smartphone every
12:13
year my point is you can't get what
12:16
Apple has with what the EU wants have
12:20
you ever heard the ship of thesis
12:23
Paradox effectively it says something
12:25
along the lines of you can replace one
12:27
single part of a ship
12:29
and it Remains the Same ship but if you
12:32
keep replacing parts of that ship with
12:34
newer Parts at what point is it no
12:37
longer the same ship at what point is it
12:40
just a new thing if we if Apple
12:43
continues to allow the EU to manipulate
12:46
core values of the company at what point
12:49
do we lose Apple how many parts have to
12:53
change
12:54
before apple is just a name
13:01
what I think needs to happen here sooner
13:03
rather than later is Tim Cook needs to
13:05
put his foot down call their Bluff
13:08
threaten to stop sales of iPhone in all
13:11
27 EU covered countries this might end
13:14
up coming down to a game of chicken just
13:16
to see who needs who more there's a line
13:20
that Apple cannot let be crossed a line
13:23
where the CEO of a company built on
13:26
strict principles has to step in to
13:29
protect those strict principles and
13:31
quietly these may be some of the biggest
13:34
decisions Tim Cook will ever have to
13:36
make he may have to decide between
13:38
saving the iPhone in 27 European
13:42
countries or
13:44
saving apple when the EU Chief says EU
13:48
regulation Fosters innovation without
13:50
compromising on security and privacy
13:53
show me show Apple show iPhone customers
13:56
how the changes they claim to want
13:58
Implement for our benefit are actually
14:01
for our benefit and not just their own
14:06
because I think what we're looking at is
14:08
someone lobbying to change the rules of
14:11
the game because someone is
14:13
winning and it isn't
14:16
them I don't see why you have to change
14:20
if you get
14:27
big
